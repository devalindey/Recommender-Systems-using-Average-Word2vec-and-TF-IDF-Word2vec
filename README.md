## **What is Word2vec?**

Word2Vec is a simple neural network model with a single hidden layer. It predicts the adjacent words for each and every word in the sentence or corpus. We need to get the weights that are learned by the hidden layer of the model and the same can be used as word embeddings.


## **Average Word2vec**

The sum of all the vectors divided by the total number of words in the description is known **Average Word2vec**. It can be calculated as follows:
